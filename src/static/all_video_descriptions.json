As he continues exploring Walmart, he decides against businesses requiring physical labour and finds himself in the craft section where he gets the idea to customize bracelets with wood-burning technology. Spending $50 on wooden beads, a wood-burning tool, and some string, the man returns home to start creating. After practicing and perfecting his skill, his first product, a wooden-bead bracelet, is complete. He then uses an online tool to generate a business name, \"Amber Edge\".
