1. Clone the repository 
2. `cd` into the repo directory
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary package dependencies
4. Copy and paste your Firebase Configuration JSON object starting at line 15 of `Video.js` to assign your account credentials to the `firebaseConfig` variable
5. Start a development server at the URL http://127.0.0.1:3000 with the command `npm start`
6. On a browser window enter and visit the URL http://127.0.0.1:3000 to run the interface locally

# Adding Your Own Videos to ShortScribe

If you want to add your own videos to ShortScribe, follow the instructions below:

1. Copy the video file into the `public/videos/` directory, and rename it to the format `<number>.mp4` (e.g. `24.mp4`)
   *  NOTE: It is highly recommended to use an mp4 file format as the code was not tested with other file formats.
2. Go to the file `src/static/video_data.json`, and add a JSON object to the end of the list of JSON objects. Below if the format for new JSON objects that the code requires:
```json
{
        "tiny_desc": "User-generated topic of the video in a couple words",
        "description": "User-generated description of the video",
        "user": "Video author handle",
        "caption": "Original caption of the original video",
        "likes": "Number of likes",
        "comments": "Number of comments",
        "bookmarks": "Number of bookmarks",
        "shares": "Number of shared",
        "originalSound": "Original sound of the video",
        "url": "Path to the video file relative to the repo directory (e.g. videos/00.mp4)",
        "video_description": "Long description generated by ShortScribe with no word limit",
        "summary_10": "Short description generated by ShortScribe",
        "summary_25": "25-word description generated by ShortScribe",
        "summary_50": "50-word description generated by ShortScribe",
        "ocr": "On-screen text",
        "shot_descriptions": "Shot-by-shot descriptions generated by ShortScribe"
}
```
3. Re-run ShortScribe on a development server, and the new video should appear in one of the tasks' video sets (video sets are shuffled randomly, so it could appear in any of the video sets)
